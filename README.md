It's Gustav but written in Go!
Old and new feature list:
- [x] Mensa meal scraper
- [x] Execute console cmds via slash commands (including a password!)
- [ ] works partially, plotting in go is pain
- [ ] Scrap the Ozon value for HD (may never work, the website is crap, perhaps I'll make my own station...)
